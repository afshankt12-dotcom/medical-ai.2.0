# 🩺 Medical AI Chatbot

An AI-powered medical chatbot built using **Python, PyTorch, Transformer Model, Retrieval-Based Question Answering, and Streamlit**. The chatbot provides medical information by answering user questions using a trained custom transformer model and a medical knowledge dataset.

> **Note:** This chatbot is designed for educational and informational purposes only. It is **not a replacement for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.**

The trained model is stored in:

```
models/medical_transformer.pth
```

Vocabulary:

```
models/vocab.json
```
